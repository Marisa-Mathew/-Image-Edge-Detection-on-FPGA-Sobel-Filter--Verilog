#  Image Edge Detection Using Sobel Filter (FPGA + Verilog + Python)

This project implements **Sobel edge detection** on grayscale images using **Verilog HDL**, designed and simulated in **Xilinx Vivado 2023.1**, with output visualized using **Python (matplotlib)**.

The edge detection is performed on a `64×64` grayscale image provided via memory initialization (`.mem` file), and the output edges are extracted using a hardware-accurate 3×3 Sobel filter window. This project is ideal for beginners for FPGA or those exploring basic computer vision on hardware.

  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

## How It Works

1. `image_loader.v`: Loads a 64×64 grayscale image from `image_mem.mem`
2. `top.v`: Builds a sliding 3×3 pixel window across image data
3. `sobel_filter.v`: Computes horizontal (Gx) and vertical (Gy) gradients
4. `top_tb.v`: Drives simulation, writes edge values to `edge_output.txt`
5. `converter_to_mem_file_code.py`: Plots the output as an edge-detected image

##  Simulation & Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Image

Use the Python script  to convert any image to a 64×64 grayscale `.mem` format:
## Simulate in Vivado
Open Vivado → Create project → Add Verilog sources and image_mem.mem

Set top_tb.v as simulation top

Run Behavioral Simulation → Click Run All

After simulation, edge_output.txt is generated and can viewed using the python script provided.


You can add any input image as per your choice and generate a memeory file.
